# 10 LangChain Applications for Generative AI
## Below are 10 applications developed using the LangChain framework. These applications demonstrate foundational implementations of Generative AI using OpenAI's GPT models.
**1. Basic Chatbot with Temporary Memory**

This chatbot leverages LangChain's ConversationBufferMemory tool to maintain a temporary record of conversation history. The memory buffer stores exchanges within a session but doesn't persist across sessions, making it ideal for stateful yet ephemeral interactions.

**2. Advanced Chatbot with Permanent Memory**

This enhanced chatbot implementation utilizes LangChain's ChatMessageHistory tool to create persistent memory storage. This allows the application to maintain user chat history across multiple sessions, enabling more personalized and contextually relevant responses over time.

**3. Key Data Extraction Application**

Designed to identify and extract specific information from text corpora, this application can parse user reviews to isolate structured data points such as first name, last name, country, and other relevant attributes. This facilitates automated information gathering from unstructured text.

**4. Sentiment Analysis Application**

This application analyzes the emotional tone and subjective viewpoints expressed in user-generated content. By processing customer reviews or social media posts, it can determine sentiment polarity, emotional intensity, and overall customer satisfaction levels.

**5. Natural Language to SQL Query Application**

This tool bridges natural language and database queries by converting user questions into proper SQL syntax. Using a pre-built LangChain chain, it interprets natural language queries, generates appropriate SQL commands, executes them against the database, and returns results in natural language format.

**6. PDF Question Answering System**

This application enables users to query information contained within PDF documents. It employs vector stores, embeddings, and semantic search capabilities to create a knowledge retrieval system that can understand document content and answer specific questions about the material.

**7. Basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application**

Built on top of a vector store, this application implements a retriever that extracts relevant context from document collections. When users pose questions, the system retrieves the most pertinent information and supplies it to the LLM through a chat prompt template, enabling more accurate and contextually informed responses.

**8. Conversational RAG Application**

This application extends beyond basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities by integrating LangChain's 'ChatMessageHistory' tool for persistent memory storage. The enhanced system maintains a comprehensive history of past interactions between users and the language model, allowing it to contextualize new queries within the broader conversation. This contextual awareness enables more coherent, relevant responses that build upon previous exchanges, creating a more natural and intelligent conversational experience.

**9. Advanced Agent Architecture with LangGraph**

This application implements a sophisticated agent architecture using LangGraph to orchestrate interactions between users, the language model, and external tools. Acting as a central decision-making system, the agent intelligently routes user queries to the appropriate resource—directing knowledge-based questions to the language model while seamlessly connecting real-time information requests to the 'TavilySearch' engine. This hybrid approach effectively overcomes the limitations of LLM training cutoff dates, enabling up-to-date responses about recent events and developments without compromising the model's core capabilities.

**10. Deploying a Simple LLm Application using LangServe**

This module demonstrates how to transition from development to production by deploying LLM applications using LangServe. The framework provides a standardized approach for packaging, serving, and scaling language model applications through RESTful APIs. The demonstration covers essential deployment considerations including configuration management, performance optimization, monitoring setup, and security implementation—providing a complete blueprint for creating production-ready LLM services accessible to users across various platforms and environments.
